The top 4 answers are 9PM, 10PM, 11PM and 0AM, which has around 200 transactions of each hour; new and returning customers acted with no significant different

Yes. Compare the two patterns below, each transaction of returning customers has more uniform distribution in amount; while new customers tend to barely make large amount transaction 

It could be due to two main reasons: weather the new customers 'trust' our website and service; weather there is lack of marketing and exposuring for expensive single transactions
